 * shell.md` and `pages/admin-shell.md` both specify it).

 * A plain anchor, never a router `Link`: the browser's own fragment navigation
 * is what moves focus to the target's `tabIndex={-1}`, and a client-side
 * navigation would skip nothing.
 *
 * Both shells wrote this identical class list before it was a component.
