/**
 * "Request session fee" (plan.md Task 20; spec §3.5 step 3, §6.15): the
 * photographer asks for what is left, and the client is emailed the amount and
 * a link to pay it on their own booking page.
 *
 * The request *is* the payment row. It is written `initiated` with the amount
 * outstanding at that moment, and that figure is then frozen: it is what the
 * client was asked for, so add-ons added afterwards do not quietly change the
 * bill in their inbox (data-model_v2.md §6.2). When the client pays,
 * `startSessionFeePayment` finds this row and uses its amount rather than
 * opening another. Nothing is charged here and no provider is called -- this
 * asks, it does not collect.
 *
 * An add-on added after a session fee has *succeeded* is a second request
 * (spec §6.15): a settled payment is never edited, so this writes another row
 * for the new difference. Only `booking_fee` is limited to one success by the
 * partial unique index, so a booking can carry as many session fees as it took.
 *
 * The email carries a **new** access token. The plaintext of the old one was
 * never stored (data-model_v2.md §5.9), and a request for money whose payment
 * link the client has to go hunting for is a request that does not get paid --
 * so this issues a link the way a resend does (spec §6.21), and the newest
 * email is the one that works.
