 * The only code in the project that touches the `setting` table for a read.

 * by a test that scans `src/` for any other import of it -- so a fee rate, a
 * notice period, a hold duration, a buffer or an expiry can be read from
 * exactly one place (data-model_v2.md §5.2).
 *
 * Seeding (`db/seed.ts`) writes this table directly rather than through here:
 * bootstrapping the one row is a different concern from reading operational
 * values, and the seed script runs once, long before any business logic asks
 * "what is the fee rate right now".
