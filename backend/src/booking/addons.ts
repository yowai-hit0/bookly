/**
 * Post-shoot add-ons (plan.md Task 20; spec §3.5 step 2, §6.15): the extra
 * photos, prints and hours agreed at the shoot itself, added to the booking
 * once it is `completed`.
 *
 * They are snapshots, exactly as the at-booking add-ons are (spec §6.13): the
 * name and unit price are copied from the catalogue as they stand when the
 * photographer adds them, so editing or deactivating that add-on later never
 * rewrites a booking's history or its total. `amount_rwf` is the product the
 * database CHECK insists on, so `bookingTotals()` can sum one column.
 *
 * Adding one raises `grandTotalRwf`, and with it what is outstanding -- there
 * is no stored total to fall out of step (data-model_v2.md §6.1), which is the
 * v1 under-reporting bug made impossible rather than fixed.
 *
 * Removing one is for the mistake just made, not for unwinding money: an
 * add-on the client has already paid for cannot be dropped, because that would
 * silently turn their payment into an overpayment nobody was told about. The
 * booking row is locked while the totals are read, so two edits at once cannot
 * each see the other's money as unspent.
