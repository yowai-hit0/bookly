/**
 * Photo delivery (plan.md Task 21; spec §3.5 steps 5-7, §6.20, A-7, A-8).
 *
 * The files live on the photographer's own host -- Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer
 * (A-7) -- and the site holds the link, the date it stops working, and the
 * branded email that hands both to the client. Nothing is uploaded here and
 * nothing is counted: under hybrid delivery a download happens entirely between
 * the client and that host, so a download count would be a number we invented
 * (data-model_v2.md §5.9).
 *
 * The expiry is a **Kigali calendar date**, which the client's page reads as
 * end of that day (spec §6.5, booking/client-view.ts): a link is live all
 * through its last day. It defaults to today plus `delivery_expiry_days` (90 by
 * A-8, a developer default the client never answered), and the photographer can
 * type any date he likes over it.
 *
 * Saving and sending are separate, because pasting a link is not the same act
 * as telling the client about it: he can paste, check it opens, and send
 * afterwards. Sending is repeatable -- a replaced link, an email that never
 * arrived (§6.20) -- and each send is its own message with its own dedupe key,
 * leaving every earlier one in the booking's history.
