/**
 * Booking creation (plan.md Task 13; spec §3.1 steps 6-8, §6.13): a chosen
 * slot and a filled form become a `pending_payment` booking holding its slot
 * for `hold_minutes`, with every snapshot written and the booking fee frozen.
 *
 * Nothing the client sent is trusted beyond the ids and the form's text. The
 * basket is priced from the catalogue as it stands (the same read the snapshots
 * come from), the start must be one the availability engine offers this
 * package right now -- out of hours, inside the lead time, off the grid, in a
 * block or already occupied are all refused -- and the claim transaction is the
 * last word on a race the engine could not see (§6.1).
 *
 * Money is computed here and nowhere later: `booking_fee_rate` and
 * `booking_fee_rwf` are written at creation per data-model_v2.md §9.5, and
 * every amount after this is `bookingTotals()` over the snapshots.
