 * Reaching a booking by its access token (plan.md Task 18; spec §2.2, §3.9,
 * §6.21): the client's whole identity, and the only way in.
 *
 * The token is looked up by the SHA-256 the booking stores, so the plaintext is
 * never compared against anything and never stored. A token that is unknown,
 * expired, or superseded by a resend answers exactly like the other two --
 * nothing found -- because "wrong token" and "no such booking" must be
 * indistinguishable: a 403 would confirm a booking exists (plan.md Task 18).
 *
 * Scope comes from the token alone. Nothing here takes a booking id, a
 * reference, or an email, so no parameter a caller adds can widen it.
