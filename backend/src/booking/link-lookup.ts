/**
 * "Email me my links" (docs/prompts/client-access-and-admin-polish.md, item 4):
 * a client types their email and gets one email with a fresh link for each
 * booking they can still act on. Reverses the 2026-09-21 decision that there is
 * no public resend (design-system/bookly/pages/client-shell.md).
 *
 * What counts as current (user decisions, 2026-09-25): a confirmed booking whose
 * shoot is still ahead, or a completed one that still owes money or whose photo
 * link has not expired.
 *
 * Nothing here is visible to the caller: the route answers the same whether an
 * address has bookings, has none, or has asked too often, so the page cannot be
 * used to learn who books. The email goes only to the address on the bookings.
 *
 * Every send replaces the links it carries (only a token's hash is stored), so
 * the rate limit is what stops a stranger who knows an address from killing
 * that client's links over and over: one email per address every 10 minutes,
 * five a day, counted from the outbox under a per-address lock so two requests
 * at once cannot both slip through.
