# Service Detail and Booking Funnel — Page Design

> **Project:** Bookly · **Route:** `/services/:slug`
> **Files (Phase 3 section 2):** `pages/services/ServiceDetail.tsx` (owns all state) and its parts `SlotPicker.tsx`, `BookingDetailsForm.tsx`, `PriceSummary.tsx`, `BookingHeld.tsx`
> Generator template: UI UX Pro Max, 2026-09-19. Its "Product Detail" text recommended WebGL/Three.js 3D, physics lighting and parallax. That is wrong for a booking funnel and contradicts MASTER's own "avoid 3D effects"; it has been removed.
> This file overrides `design-system/bookly/MASTER.md` for this page. Read MASTER's "Hand-review addendum" first.

## The funnel on one page

The generator's "Funnel (3-Step Conversion)" maps onto this page, but as three progressive groups on one route, not three pages:

1. **Choose**: package (radio cards, nothing preselected) and optional add-ons (checkbox rows).
2. **Pick a time**: month calendar, then the bookable starts for the chosen date. Appears only once a package is chosen; before that a placeholder heading + hint (`services:picker.choosePackageFirst`).
3. **Your details**: the booking form. Also appears only once a package is chosen.

The submit control lives in the price summary and is shown only once a start is chosen (otherwise the hint `services:booking.chooseTimeFirst`). On success the whole page is replaced by the held-booking summary (`BookingHeld`).

Step numbers: mark groups 1-3 with **CSS counters only** (numerals in the heading font, no new text). Add-ons belong visually to step 1 and are not numbered.

## Layout

- `main`, `max-w-5xl`, `px-4 py-8`, `gap-6`.
- Top: back link ("<- All services", muted sm) -> header: cover image (`aspect-21/9`, `rounded-xl`, `object-cover`) -> `h1` (3xl semibold) -> description (`whitespace-pre-line`, muted).
- Below the header, from `lg`: grid `[1fr_22rem]`, `items-start`, `gap-6`. Left column = groups 1-3; right column = price summary, `lg:sticky lg:top-4`.
- Below `lg`: single column in DOM order: package -> add-ons -> picker -> form -> **price summary + submit last**. Keep that order (reading order and tab order follow it). Give the summary a clear top separation so it reads as the closing step.

## Selectable cards (packages, add-ons, and the same pattern in `PaymentFields`)

- Native radio/checkbox stays visible and keeps `accent-primary`. The card is the label.
- Selected state must not rely on the 1px border colour alone: add a tinted fill (`has-checked:bg-primary/5`) and keep the focus ring (`has-focus-visible:ring-3`).
- Package card: name (medium) + price (semibold, `tabular-nums`, right) on one wrapping row; then "N photos · duration" muted; then optional description (`whitespace-pre-line`).
- Add-on row: name (flex-1) + price (`tabular-nums`).

## Slot picker (`SlotPicker`)

- One bordered `rounded-xl` panel, `p-4`, `gap-3`: month row (icon-only outline prev/next buttons with `aria-label`, month title `aria-live="polite"`); 7-column day grid; then status lines.
- Day cell (`h-10`, `rounded-lg`, `tabular-nums`): **available** = bold text on the `muted` surface, hover darker; **unavailable** = disabled, muted at ~50%, no surface; **selected** = `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`. Available vs unavailable must differ by weight *and* surface, not colour alone. No "today" marker exists; do not add logic for one.
- Times: `grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-4`, outline buttons, selected = default variant, `aria-pressed`. **Make time buttons at least 44px tall** (today 32px, the `default` size); mobile is the main device.
- Messages: "just taken" and "check failed" are `role="alert"`, `text-destructive`, `font-medium`, and receive focus (`tabIndex=-1`); "checking" and "selected" are `role="status"`. Keep all of it.
- Empty month, loading and load-failed (alert + outline "Retry") states all stay.

## Details form (`BookingDetailsForm`)

- Single column, `gap-4`; label above each field; hints under the field; error under the field (destructive, linked with `aria-describedby`). Raise hints and errors from `text-xs` to `text-sm`.
- Fields: name, email, phone (hint), location, party size (hint, numeric), special requests (textarea, hint), consent checkbox row (whole row is the label, text `text-sm`, box `size-4`).
- Inputs at least 16px text on mobile and 44px tall (no iOS zoom). The form is `noValidate` and uncontrolled: keep.

## Price summary (`PriceSummary`)

- Card: `bg-card rounded-xl border p-4`, `gap-3`. Lines as a `dl`: label left, amount right, `tabular-nums`.
- Hierarchy: total row (`border-t`, base, semibold) > booking fee row (`font-medium`, this is "due now") > session fee row (regular, "after the shoot").
- The **non-refundable notice** is always visible and is rendered **before** the submit control; no control leading to payment may come before it. Give it a callout treatment: subtle tinted surface, full border, small icon (`aria-hidden`). **No left-border stripe** (Impeccable flags `side-tab`).
- Submit: full-width default button; `aria-disabled` while submitting (not `disabled`). Submission errors appear below it as `role="alert"`.

## Held booking (`BookingHeld`)

- Replaces the page content inside the same `main`; `section`, `max-w-2xl`, left-aligned. `h1` (3xl) takes focus on mount (`tabIndex=-1`, `outline-none`).
- The **reference** is the thing the client keeps: mono, semibold, larger than surrounding text.
- Summary `dl` card (reference, service, when, package, add-ons, total, booking fee, session fee) then: hold-expiry sentence (give it a callout with a clock icon, it is time-critical), non-refundable notice, then the **"Pay" button**, `size="lg"`, the only prominent action. It renders only when `checkoutToken` exists.
- No countdown timer: the API gives a time, not a live counter, and adding one is new logic.

## Page states to cover

loading; load failed (alert + retry); missing slug (renders `NotFound`); no packages (muted text); package chosen with no start; start chosen; submitting; submit refused (`failed`, `catalogueChanged`, invalid fields, slot taken); held.

## Do not

- No modal, wizard or stepper text, no new copy, no motion beyond 150-300ms state transitions.
- Do not move the price summary above the form on mobile (changes reading order).
