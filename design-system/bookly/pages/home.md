# Home / Landing — Page Design

> **Project:** Bookly · **Route:** `/` · **File:** `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx` · **Phase 3 section:** 1
> Generator template: UI UX Pro Max, 2026-09-19 ("Landing / Marketing", 1200px). Its pattern was wrong for the stub and set aside; **it applies now** and the notes below are the hand-written version of it.
> This file overrides `design-system/bookly/MASTER.md` for this page. Read MASTER's "Hand-review addendum" first.
> **Superseded 2026-09-21.** The 2026-09-20 decision recorded here was "restyle the stub only", because a landing page needed copy that did not exist. The user has now asked for the landing page and authorised new `en.json` keys under a new namespace, so the stub is replaced. Section 1's applied styling (the type scale, the button that hugs its label) carries forward; this is not a restart.
> **Applied 2026-09-20 (Phase 3 section 1)** to the stub. What was chosen beyond this file is in `MASTER.md` section 11.

## What this page is now

The public entry point. Before this, `/` was an API health check (`home:apiStatus`, `home:recheck`) with no link to anything, and the page clients actually used was `/services`. The health stub is gone from the page; **its `home:*` keys stay in `en.json`** — existing strings are never edited or removed, and nothing else reads them.

**Nothing on this page may be invented.** There is no photographer name, no logo, no portfolio, no testimonial and no review (`docs/redesign-pending.md` section 2: brand assets are still outstanding). Every claim below is a fact the code already enforces, and the service names and prices are **fetched from the API**, never written into the page.

## Layout (section order)

Inside the client shell (`pages/client-shell.md`), so the header and footer are not this page's business. The page renders its own `main`, `flex-col`, sections separated by `py-16` / `sm:py-20` rhythm, each section's inner width `mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4`.

1. **Hero**
2. **Services preview**
3. **How it works**
4. **What you can count on** (trust)
5. **Closing call to action**

### 1. Hero

- Typographic, not photographic: there is no image to use, and a stock photo would be a claim about work that was never supplied.
- `h1` at `text-4xl sm:text-5xl`, heading font, semibold, `text-balance`, `max-w-3xl`. One supporting paragraph, `text-lg muted`, `max-w-xl`, `text-pretty`.
- One primary button: **"Book now" -> `/services`**. The same label as the header's button, deliberately — it is the same action, and a second name for it would be a second thing to learn. Tests must scope by landmark (`banner` vs `main` vs `contentinfo`), because this label exists three times on this page.
- A quiet secondary line under the button may name the booking-fee mechanic in one sentence. **No second button**: one primary action per screen (MASTER).
- Background: the page's tinted `--background`, with the hero optionally lifted on a soft `--primary`-tinted wash. No gradient text, no blurred blobs, no animated mesh (MASTER anti-patterns).
- On a phone the hero starts at `py-12`, not a full viewport height. A 100svh hero that shows nothing but a sentence is a wasted screen.

### 2. Services preview

- **Real data, from `fetchServices`** — the same call `/services` makes. Show the **first three** services, in the API's order, in the **same `ServiceCard` presentation** the service list uses. Reusing that card is the point: a client who taps through sees the thing they just saw, not a different design of it.
- Section heading `h2`. A "see the rest" link to `/services` sits after the grid. **Its accessible name must not be "All services"** — that exact name is matched page-wide by three e2e specs.
- **Degrade quietly.** This is a marketing section, not the booking funnel: if the API fails, render **nothing at all** — no red alert, no retry button, no empty-state apology. The hero and its CTA still work, and `/services` shows the real error with the real retry. Same when the list is empty.
- Grid: `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`, matching the list page.

### 3. How it works

- Four steps, as an ordered list (`ol`), `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`, each a number, a short heading (`h3`) and one sentence.
- The steps are the real flow and nothing else: choose a service and package -> pick a date and time -> pay the booking fee to hold the time -> get a private link to the booking, and the photos when they are ready.
- The step number is decorative (`aria-hidden`) — the `ol` already carries the order for a screen reader.

### 4. What you can count on

- Three or four short items, each a heading and a sentence. **Facts, not promises**, each one true of the shipped code:
  - the full price is shown before anything is paid;
  - the time is held while payment goes through;
  - the booking fee is non-refundable if the client cancels — **stated here, not only at checkout.** Putting the one unfavourable term on the landing page is the whole point of the section; a trust block that lists only good news is marketing, and this app takes money from people;
  - every booking has a private link, and it can be cancelled from there.
- Icons optional, `size-5`, `aria-hidden`, always paired with words. Cards or plain blocks, not a bordered grid that reads as a pricing table.
- **No testimonials, no counters ("200+ shoots"), no badges, no five-star rows.** None of it exists.

### 5. Closing call to action

- One band, `bg-primary`-tinted surface or `bg-card`, a single line and the same "Book now" button. Short. It exists because the page is long enough that the hero's button has scrolled away.

## Type and rhythm

Section headings `h2` at `text-2xl sm:text-3xl`, heading font. Body `text-base`, muted where it supports a heading. Vertical rhythm comes from MASTER's spacing scale; sections alternate `bg-background` and `bg-card` at most once, and never more than twice on the page.

## States

The page has effectively one state. The services preview has three (loading, some, none/failed) and **two of them render nothing**: no skeleton that shifts the page, no spinner. Reserve the grid's height only if a loaded state would otherwise jump the fold.

## Accessibility

- Exactly **one `h1`** on the page, and it is the hero's. The header's wordmark is a link.
- "Book now" appears in the header, the hero and the closing band. All three go to the same place, so three identical accessible names are correct; do not disambiguate them with invented suffixes like "Book now (hero)".
- Every section that is a real region gets a heading; do not use `aria-label` to name a section that already has an `h2`.

## Do not

- No photographer name, logo, portfolio, testimonial, review, price or service name written into the page or into `en.json`. Prices and names come from the API.
- No hero image, stock photography or illustration.
- No newsletter signup, chat widget, cookie banner, or "as seen in" row.
- No scroll-jacking, parallax, count-up animation or entrance animation on every section.
- Do not restore the API status check; do not delete the `home:*` keys it used.
