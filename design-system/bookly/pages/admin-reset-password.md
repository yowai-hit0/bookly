# Admin Reset Password — Page Design

> **Project:** Bookly · **Phase 3 section:** 5 (with the admin shell and login)
> **Route:** `/admin/reset-password` — declared **outside** `AdminLayout` (signed out by definition, so no sidebar and no session guard)
> **File:** `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminResetPassword.tsx` (shared `AdminField.tsx`)
> **Added by the discovery rule (2026-09-21):** the page shipped as feature work on `main` (commit `d02bd41`) and had no design file, so Section 5 would have restyled it blind.
> This file overrides `design-system/bookly/MASTER.md` for this page. Read MASTER's "Hand-review addendum" first.

One route doing two jobs, told apart by whether the emailed link carried a token in the URL **fragment**: ask for the link, or choose the new password. The fragment is never sent to a server, so it reaches no log, proxy or referrer — nothing in the visual pass may put the token into a link, a heading, an `img` URL or anything else that navigates.

## Layout — the same frame as login

`main`, `max-w-sm`, `min-h-svh`, vertically centred, `p-6`. One `Card` on the tinted page background, with real separation (border/ring plus `shadow-md`), not a hairline. This page and `/admin/login` must be visibly the same place: same width, same centring, same card, same optional wordmark above it. A photographer arrives here *from* login, and arriving somewhere that looks different reads as a phishing page.

`Card` -> `CardHeader` (`CardTitle` wrapping the `h1`) -> `CardContent` (`flex-col gap-4`).

Each of the three shapes ends with the **"Back to sign in"** link, muted `text-sm`, `underline-offset-4 hover:underline`, as the last thing in the card. It is the only way out and it is always present.

## Shape 1 — request the link (no token)

`h1` = request title -> body `p` (`text-sm muted`) -> form: one email field -> error -> submit (full width, `disabled` while submitting, label swaps).

- The email input is `type="email" autoComplete="username"`, 44px tall, 16px text. Password managers must keep working.
- **After a successful request the form is replaced** by the confirmation (`role="status"`, `text-sm`), with the back link below it. Give it a `MailCheck` icon (`size-4`) above or beside the sentence, and keep the card the same width so nothing jumps.
- **The confirmation says the same thing whether or not that address can sign in.** The API answers 202 either way. Nothing in the visual treatment may hint at the difference — no "we found your account" tone, no different icon, no different colour. This is a security property of the page, not a copy preference.
- The failure message (`role="alert"`, destructive, `text-sm`) means our side broke and no email is coming; it sits directly above the button.

## Shape 2 — choose the new password (token present)

`h1` = choose title -> body `p` -> form: new password, confirm password, error, submit.

- Both inputs `type="password" autoComplete="new-password"`, 44px, 16px. No "show password" toggle: that is new state and a new string.
- The **12-character rule is a hint on the first field** (`AdminField`'s hint slot), visible before anything is typed — not an error that only appears after a failed attempt. The mismatch error belongs to the second field.
- Validation errors are local and instant; the token errors are not. Keep them in different places: field errors under their field, the invalid/expired-token and request-failed messages in one `role="alert"` above the button.
- **An invalid or expired token is the page's dead end**, and it must not look like a typo. It keeps the form on screen (retyping will not help, but hiding the form loses the person entirely) and the alert carries a `TriangleAlert` icon; the back link below it is the real exit.

## Shape 3 — done

`h1` = done title -> confirmation `p` (`role="status"`) -> a **primary button** to `/admin/login` (`asChild` on a `Link`, `self-start`).

This is the one shape where the way out is a button, not the muted link — the job is finished and there is exactly one thing to do next. Do not also render the muted back link here; two controls to the same place is a false choice.

## States

request: idle, submitting, sent, failed.
choose: idle, too-short, mismatch, submitting, invalid token, failed, done.

## Login's side of it

The login page gets the **"Forgot your password?"** link this page pays for: muted `text-sm`, below the submit button, left-aligned, never styled as a second button. Recorded here rather than in `pages/admin-login.md`, which says the link "comes with the reset-password page" — that page now exists.

## Do not

- No sidebar, no nav, no skip link: this page is outside the shell.
- No password-strength meter, no "show password" toggle, no email re-entry field: each is new state or new copy.
- Never render, echo, link or log the token. It exists only in the fragment and in one POST body.
- No new copy. Every string already exists under `admin:resetPassword.*`.
